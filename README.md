# Connected Data London 2024masterclass: Entity Resolved Knowledge Graphs

> I found Louis's work in Part 4 particularly interesting.  He ended up creating his own Python library after his attempts to fix a 5 year old Microsoft Approximate Nearest Neighbours library hit some road blocks.  You can see some of his notes here:  https://github.com/donbr/erkg-tutorials/blob/main/dev.ipynb

> Also of note are Louis's use of Dagster:  https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adonbr%2Ferkg-tutorials%20dagster&type=code

<https://2024.connected-data.london/talks/how-to-create-knowledge-graphs-from-structured-and-unstructured-data-based-on-entity-resolution-to-enhance-downstream-ai-applications/>

In this masterclass, we will step through how to generate knowledge
graphs from structured and unstructured data based on _entity
resolution_ (ER) to enhance data quality for the downstream AI applications.
We'll reuse components from six open source tutorials.
Overall, these illustrate a process for using ER as a basis for
blending elements from structured and unstructured data into
knowledge graphs used for GraphRAG and other kinds of AI apps.

These tutorials each have related articles, code repositories,
slide decks, and videos.
The main concepts connecting the components of these tutorials were
described in in the article
["Unbundling the Graph in GraphRAG"](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/unbundling-the-graph-in-graphrag/).

Given the time constraints of the course, please start early on the
downloads for _Part 1_ and _Part 3_.

## Abstract

Graph RAG has become a buzzword in the tech industry recently, given
the popularity of using knowledges graphs to "ground" LLMs with
domain-specific facts. This approach improves the overall quality of
responses in AI applications by reducing "hallucination" in the
results. It also allows for faster data updates and helps reduce the
need (and costs) for fine-tuning LLM models.

While most Graph RAG examples tend to use LLMs to generate graph
elements automatically, we'll step back and examine the workflows
needed for generating knowledge graphs from structured and
unstructured data sources. By employing state-of-the-art open models
and open source libraries at each step, in this masterclass we will
explore how to combine the use of entity resolution and entity linking
to produce graphs that emphasize data quality, curation, and feedback
from domain experts, while making affordances for audits,
evidence-based decision making, and practices required for
mission-critical enterprise applications in highly-regulated
environments.

Overall, we will discuss a generalized architecture for how to
construct and update knowledge graphs using a blend of structured and
unstructured data sources, and consider the impact of entity
resolution on downstream usage.


## Syllabus

Target Audience:

  - data science teams
  - people with general interest in AI (especially highly-regulated environments)

Level:

  - intermediate

Prerequisites:

  - some experience coding in Python
  - familiarity with popular packages such as Pandas, Jupyter, Docker

Goals:

  - gain hands-on experience creating knowledge graphs from both structured sources and unstructured sources, for use in a Graph RAG application
  - follow practices which emphasize data quality plus affordances for audits, evidence handling, and trustworthy AI applications
  - use entity resolution to create the "backbone" of a knowledge graph from structured data sources
  - compare use of contemporary state-of-the-art open models and open source libraries in Python for extracting graph elements from unstructured data sources
  - use entity resolution results to build a context-sensitive entity linker, blending graph elements from structured and unstructured sources

Key Topics:

  - distinguish among the key terminology: entity resolution, named entity recognition, relation extraction, entity linking
  - leverage entity resolution to provide a semantic overlay on records from structured data, i.e., generating graph elements while preserving evidence
  - using a _textgraph_ algorithm to construct a lexical graph alongside the text chunking and embedding needed for _retrieval augmented generation_ (RAG)
  - graph construction practices which are consistent with the needs of trustworthy AI applications, audits, evidence-based decision making, etc.
  - case studies for production use cases which leverage these practices
  - why not simply use an LLM to do all of the work?

Format:

The class will start with a lecture describing important terms and
practices:
<https://derwen.ai/s/khj9#0>

Then we'll move to hands-on coding examples in Python, working with
a collection of Jupyter notebooks which are available in the linked
GitHub code repositories.

To make the most of the time available (2 hours) we will link to some
other online tutorials for deep-dives into specific areas which are
beyond the scope of this class.

## Outline

  * Start with _open datasets_ for sanctions compliance (e.g., money laundering, ultimate beneficial ownership, and related work) as structured data sources
  * Use _entity resolution_ to identify entities and relations which have supporting evidence (e.g., for use in investigations)
  * Construct a "backbone" graph from structured data sources plus a _semantic overlay_ of entities and relations
  * Load unstructured data (e.g., from relevant news articles) and split into text chunks organized in a vector database, based on an _embedding model_
  * Parse the text chunks to generate a _lexical graph_, then use a textgraph algorithm to extract its most important elements
  * Build a context-specific _entity linker_ based on entity resolution results above, blending unstructured elements into the "backbone" graph
  * Show how to use the resulting knowledge graph and vector database together in a _GraphRAG_ application

This would the logical order for how the components fit together in a
production workflow.
Working not exactly in this order, we will consider each step and
highlight how the parts get integrated together.


### Part 1: Entity Resolution playground, with open data

This initial set of tutorials shows the basics for how to use _entity
resolution_ (ER) to merge datasets, which generates graph elements:

NB: there's another set of ER intro tutorials at <https://senzing.com/docs/quickstart/>


### Part 2: ERKG tutorial, from structured data sources to GraphRAG

This next section explores how to create knowledge graphs based on
entity resolution using structured data sources.
Based on the article ["Entity Resolved Knowledge Graphs: A Tutorial"](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/entity-resolved-knowledge-graphs/),
the first part loads data from three sources about businesses in
the Las Vegas metro area.
Merging these datasets using ER, we'll visualize potential
[PPP loan fraud](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nv/pr/nevada-man-convicted-112-million-covid-19-fraud)
during the pandemic.

Given our time constraints, we won't re-run this code.
Instead we will explore some Jupyter notebooks which show the execution
step-by-step and the results:
<https://github.com/DerwenAI/ERKG/tree/main/examples>

The second part (by Clair Sullivan) is described in the article
["When GraphRAG Goes Bad: A Study in Why you Cannot Afford to Ignore Entity Resolution"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-graphrag-goesbad-study-why-you-cannot-afford-ignore-sullivan-7ymnc/).
Clair adds _GraphRAG_ to the Las Vegas PPP tutorial using
[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) to produce a chatbot
for exploring potential fraud.
The execution time is longer than our class, so we'll review results:

  - code: <https://github.com/cj2001/erkg_demo>
  - video: <https://senzing.com/gph-ep-2-graphrag-boost-llm-apps/>

See also the
[`sz-graph-export`](https://github.com/senzing-garage/sz-graph-export)
utility by Jeff Butcher, for exporting ER results from Senzing as a
[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) graph.


### Part 3: Unbundled KG construction from unstructured data

Next, let's explore how to [unbundle KG construction](https://derwen.ai/s/khj9#19)
based on unstructured data, instead of simply throwing all the data at an LLM!

  - code: <https://github.com/DerwenAI/strwythura>
  - video: <https://youtu.be/B6_NfvQL-BE>
  - slides: <https://derwen.ai/s/2njz#1>

Following the instructions in the `README.md` we'll run these notebooks:

  * `construct.ipynb` -- detailed KG construction using a lexical graph
  * `chunk.ipynb` -- simple example of how to scrape and chunk text
  * `vector.ipynb` -- query LanceDB table for text chunk embeddings (after having run `demo.py`)
  * `embed.ipynb` -- query the entity embedding model (after having run `demo.py`)


### Part 4: Entity Linking, connecting elements into a comprehensive graph

In this final section, we'll show how to reuse ER results to train an
_entity linker_ to blend structured and unstructured graph elements.
This part ties the other sections together into a whole picture.

The process was developed by Louis Guitton, which he described in the article
["Panama Papers Investigation using Entity Resolution and Entity Linking"](https://guitton.co/posts/entity-resolution-entity-linking).

Louis employs a `spaCy` pipeline component [`spacy-lancedb-linker`](https://github.com/louisguitton/spacy-lancedb-linker)
which you can [download from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/spacy-lancedb-linker/).
The tutorial is available in:
<https://github.com/louisguitton/erkg-tutorials>

We won't be able to run all of this tutorial during our class,
and instead we'll review the results in:
<https://github.com/louisguitton/erkg-tutorials/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb>
